## Development Setup

### Requirements
- `Windows 10 / 11` operating system
- `Visual Studio 2026` (recommended)
- `C++ 20` or later
- `C++/WinRT WinUI3` development workload

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OpenStarlight/StarlightGUI.git
   cd StarlightGUI
   ```

2. **Open the project in Visual Studio**
   - Open `Visual Studio`
   - Select `Open a project or solution`
   - Navigate to the project directory and select the `.sln` solution file

3. **Restore NuGet packages**
   - Right-click the solution in Solution Explorer
   - Select `Restore NuGet Packages`

4. **Configure the build environment**
   - Make sure the correct build configuration is selected (Debug/Release)
   - This project depends on `WinUI3` — ensure the architecture is configured correctly

5. **Build and run**
   - Use the menu: `Build` → `Build Solution`

6. **Create a distributable package**
   - Extract all files from the `x64/Release(Debug)` folder in the project directory — `StarlightGUI.exe` is the executable
   - You may create an archive or installer from these files

(OPTIONAL) **Notes**
1. If you encounter breakpoints caused by `Invalid parameter` errors when launching the project, simply ignore them — they do not affect program execution.
2. If the app crashes when switching to certain pages, try disabling `XAML Hot Reload` in Visual Studio.
